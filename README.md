# User Management System with NestJS and MySQL

This project is a secure and modular user management system built with NestJS framework and MySQL database. It implements JWT-based authentication and role-based access control, ensuring a scalable and maintainable backend architecture.

---

# Features

- Complete JWT authentication implementation  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Advanced data validation with `class-validator`  
- Modular architecture separating concerns (Repository, Service, Controller)  
- MySQL database integration using Sequelize ORM  
- Robust error handling and logging  
- API documentation ready for Swagger (extendable)  



# Prerequisites

- Node.js (Recommended version 16 or above)  
- MySQL (Version 5.7 or higher)  
- npm or yarn package manager  



# Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**  

   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   cd project-name
  ````


# Install dependencies

1. **Install:**

```bash
npm install
```

# Create a .env file in the project root and configure environment variables:

2. **Create a .env file**

```bash

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=user_managementDB
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

```

# Create the MySQL database:

3. **MySQL database:**

```bash

CREATE DATABASE user_managementDB;

```

# Run the application in development mode:

4. **Run the application:**

```bash

npm run start:dev

```

# API Usage

Default URL: http://localhost:3000/

Authentication uses JWT tokens.

User routes are protected with JWT and role-based guards (e.g., admin only).

# Project Structure

```bash

src/
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/                  # Authentication (JWT, services, controllers)
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                # Configuration and environment management
â”œâ”€â”€ users/                 # User management (model, service, repository, controller, DTO)
â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts                # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ app.module.ts          # Root module

```
# Security Notes
Passwords should be hashed (e.g., with bcrypt) before saving to database (to be implemented)

Keep JWT_SECRET confidential and only in environment variables

Use migrations and set synchronize: false in production

All requests are validated and access is controlled by roles

# Development and Contribution
Follow NestJS and TypeScript best practices

Use linting and formatting tools for clean code

Unit and integration tests are recommended for maintainability
