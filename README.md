#User Management System with NestJS and MySQL

This project is a secure and modular user management system built with NestJS framework and MySQL database. It implements JWT-based authentication and role-based access control, ensuring a scalable and maintainable backend architecture.

---

#Features

- Complete JWT authentication implementation  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Advanced data validation with `class-validator`  
- Modular architecture separating concerns (Repository, Service, Controller)  
- MySQL database integration using Sequelize ORM  
- Robust error handling and logging  
- API documentation ready for Swagger (extendable)  

---

#Prerequisites

- Node.js (Recommended version 16 or above)  
- MySQL (Version 5.7 or higher)  
- npm or yarn package manager  

---

#Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   cd project-name
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and configure environment variables:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=user_managementDB
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Create the MySQL database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE user_managementDB;
   ```

5. Run the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## API Usage

* Default URL: `http://localhost:3000/`
* Authentication uses JWT tokens.
* User routes are protected with JWT and role-based guards (e.g., admin only).

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/                  # Authentication (JWT, services, controllers)
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                # Configuration and environment management
â”œâ”€â”€ users/                 # User management (model, service, repository, controller, DTO)
â”œâ”€â”€ main.ts                # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ app.module.ts          # Root module
```

---

## Security Notes

* Passwords should be hashed (e.g., with bcrypt) before saving to database (to be implemented)
* Keep `JWT_SECRET` confidential and only in environment variables
* Use migrations and set `synchronize: false` in production
* All requests are validated and access is controlled by roles

---

## Development and Contribution

* Follow NestJS and TypeScript best practices
* Use linting and formatting tools for clean code
* Unit and integration tests are recommended for maintainability
